## About

After years of heavy computer use, my eyes started to suffer from Computer Vision Syndrome. I wrote this simple app to remind me to get up every 20 minutes and stare at something 20 meters away. This has also been a big help with dealing with the sore neck and back that come with being a computer nerd.
